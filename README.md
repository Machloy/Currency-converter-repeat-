## Description

The website is created for the Youcode course. It presents a short description of one of my favorite fantasy book authors. Thanks to this project, I was able to recall what I had learned so far. The task was not difficult, but I am satisfied with the end result anyway. Enjoy!

The website is written in simple HTML, CSS also JS.
